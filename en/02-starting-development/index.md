## Starting development
Before we can begin, we must have some sort of idea about how to develop our game. Planning is important. I never start a game without sitting down and thinking about how it will be played and how I need to break down all the required pieces into manageable tasks. In this case we are reeplicating an existing game. Let's take a look at it and break it down into pieces.
